# rmdtester
This is part of OPNFV-VSPERF project. 
Use rmdtester to test the Intel-RMD at work. User can
1. Configure workloads
2. Configure cache allocaiton policy
3. Start workloads in an order.
4. Setup cache allocations.
5. Terminate workloads
6. Cleanup allocations.

While doing above steps, it would be helpful for user to constantly monitor the L3-Cache usage using OPNFV_BAROMETER_COLLECTD.
